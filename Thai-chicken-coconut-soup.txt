1 handful dried kaffir lime leaves
1 tbsp chopped coriander stalks
1 lemon grass stem, finely chopped
Zest of 1 lime

1 tsp turmeric

250ml chicken stock

12 cherry tomatoes

Chopped coriander leaves
Thai basil leaves

1 can or carton of coconut milk

Firing
Heat about 3 tbsp oil in a large saucepan and add the dried chilis. Fry until they're fragrant (probably about 30 seconds, depending on how hot the oil is).  Add the onions and a small pinch of salt and fry until golden. Add the ginger, garlic, chili mixture and continue to fry until the rawness is gone. Add the lime zest, lemon grass, lime leaves and coriander stalks and mix. Fry until fragrant. Add 1 tsp turmeric.

At this point, add about 250ml boiling water to the pan to deglaze and add one chicken stock cube/jelly. Add 2 tsp sugar and 1-2 tbsp fish sauce to taste. Add a can of coconut milk and mix all the ingredients. Reduce the heat to low, place a lid on the pan and allow to cook for about 40 minutes.

After 40 minutes of simmering, add the sliced chicken pieces and allow the soup to warm back up to a simmer. Then add about 12 cherry tomatoes. Adjust the flavor with salt and sugar as needed. Place a lid on the pan and allow the soup to stop boiling for about 5 minutes.

Add the juice of 1 lime and some fresh coriander and thai basil leaves.
