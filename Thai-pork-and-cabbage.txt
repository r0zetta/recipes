Mise en place
400g pork kassler sliced into thin strips

1/4 cabbage sliced into about 1cm wide and 4cm long pieces

3 green onions, white end sliced into 1/2cm pieces, green parts sliced into 4cm long pieces

4 garlic cloves finely chopped

Sauce:
2 tbsp fish sauce
2 tbsp oyster sauce
2 tbsp light soy sauce
2 tsp sugar
1 tsp white pepper powder
2 tbsp water

Heat about 1 tbsp oil on a wok and add the garlic. Fry until the garlic starts
to turn golden. Add the pork slices and fry until slightly crispy. Add the
cabbage and mix well. Fry, stirring occasionally for about 4 minutes, until the
cabbage has softened slightly. Add the sauce, mix and cook until the sauce has
reduced slightly and coats the ingredients. Add the green onions, mix and keep
on the heat for about 30 seconds. Serve over rice.
