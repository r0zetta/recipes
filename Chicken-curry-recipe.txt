Chicken Curry

Mise en place
6 boneless chicken thighs, cut into cubes

3 medium onions cut into thin slices

1 tbsp chopped garlic
1 tbsp chopped ginger
10 chopped fresh red chilis

1 tsp coriander seeds
1 tsp cumin seeds
1 tsp fennel seeds
1 inch piece of cinnamon, broken into a few pieces
4 cardamom pods, slightly broken with the back of a knife
4 cloves
5 small dried red chilis, broken into pieces, including seeds

1 tsp turmeric powder
1 tsp cayenne pepper
1 tsp dried mint leaves
1 tsp garam masala

small handful of curry leaves

4 chopped tomatoes

Firing
Sprinkle salt onto the chicken pieces and sear them off in batches in a hot pan.

Toast the coriander seeds, cumin seeds, fennel seeds, cinnamon, cardamom pods,
cloves and dried red chilis and then grind them in a pestle and mortar. Add the
turmeric powder, chili powder, mint leaves and garam masala powder and mix.

Put 3 tbsp cooking oil into a large saucepan and heat. When the oil is hot, add
the ginger, garlic and chili and cook for about 30 seconds. Add the onions and
cook slowly for about 5 minutes. Add the tomatoes, spice powder and a handful of
curry leaves and mix well. Allow to cook with the lid on over low heat until the
mixture has darkened, the tomatoes are completely mashed up and oil can be seen
at the edges.

Add the chicken pieces and all juices from the chicken and mix well. Allow the curry to simmer for a few minutes to finish cooking the chicken. Adjust the flavour by adding sugar and salt at this point.
