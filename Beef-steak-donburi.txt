Beef Steak Donburi

Mise en place
2 beef steaks

1 large onion slice into 1cm slices

4 large mushrooms cut into 1cm slices

1 lettuce cut into 1cm wide strips

Watercress

2 tbsp sake

3 tbsp grated onion

1/2 tbsp grated garlic

Ponzu Sauce
1.5 tbsp light soy
1.5 tbsp lime juice
1 tsp mirin
1/2 tsp dashi powder

Firing
Fry the onions and mushrooms in a little oil, adding salt and pepper while
cooking. Set aside.

Salt and pepper one side of each steak. Heat a small amount of oil in a pan
until hot and place the steaks on the pan. Sear until a nice crust forms on one
side and then flip and repeat with the other side. Place the steaks aside,
covered with foil to rest for a few minutes.

Add sake to a hot frying pan and allow it to boil slightly. Add the grated onion
and stir, cooking until the raw flavour has gone. Add the ponzu sauce and grated
garlic and cook on low heat for another minute. Add about 1 tbsp butter to the
sauce, allow it to melt and mix it in. Pour the sauce into a separate container.

Place chopped lettuce on top of a bowl of hot steamed rice. Place the onion and
mushrooms onto the lettuce. Slice the beef using diagonal cuts into about 1cm
thick slices. Garnish with watercress. Pour on the onion ponzu gravy.
