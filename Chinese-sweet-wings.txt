Chinese sweet and spicy wings

Mise en place
500g chicken wings

3 star anise
5 cloves
small piece of cinnamon
1 tsp szechuan pepper corns
1 tsp fennel seeds

1 tbsp soft brown sugar

1 tbsp soy sauce

3 tbsp corn starch

Sauce:
1 tbsp light soy
1 tbsp dark soy
2 tbsp wine
2 tbsp sugar
1 tsp grated ginger
1 tsp grated garlic
2 tbsp water

1/2 tsp Chiankiang vinegar

4 fresh red chilis
2 tbsp sesame seeds

Firing:
Roase the star anise, cloves, cinnamon, szechaun pepper corns and fennel seeds
on a frying pan until fragrant. Crush into a fine powder using a pestle and
mortar. Mix these spices with the soft brown sugar.

Pat the chicken wings dry and place them in a plastic bag along with the spice
and sugar mix. Shake to coat evenly and then seal the bag, having pushed out as
much air as possible. Leave for 2 hours.

Add 1 tbsp soy sauce to the bag and mix to coat the wings. Re-seal the bag and
leave overnight.

Remove the wings from the bag and drain any excess liquid with a colander. Pat
dry with kitchen paper. Place the wings into a new bag along with 3 tbsp corn
starch and shake to coat the wings evenly.

Place the wings on a baking rack on top of a baking tray and cook them in the
oven at 200C for 45 minutes.

Place the sauce ingredients in a small pan and bring it to the boil. Simmer the
sauce and allow it to reduce slightly. Remove the sauce from the heat and add
1/2tsp vinegar.

Once the chicken wings come out of the oven, place them in a bowl and add the
sauce. Mix well to cover the wings. Serve the wings, sprinkled with finely
chopped red chilis and sesame seeds.
