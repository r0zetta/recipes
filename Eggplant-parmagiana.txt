Eggplant Parmagiana

Mise en place
3 large eggplants, sliced lengthways into 1cm thick pieces
1 large jar of marinara sauce (or make your own)
4 balls of mozzarella cut into 1/2 slices
finely grated parmesan
bread crumbs

Firing
Brush the slices of eggplant with olive oil and place on a baking tray. Bake in
the oven at 200C until golden brown on the top.

Coat the bottom of a baking dish with some olive oil and place a layer of
eggplant slices in the dish. Sprinkle some breadcrumbs and grated parmesan on
each slice. Cover each piece of eggplant with mozzarella slices and then cover
the whole layer with a thin coating of marinara sauce. Repeat this layering with
the remaining eggplant and other ingredients. Finally, sprinkle breadcrumbs and
grated parmesan on the top. Bake in an oven at 200C for about 45 minutes, or
until golden brown on top and fully melted and bubbling.
