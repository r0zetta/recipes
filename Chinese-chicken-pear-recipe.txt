Chinese chicken and pear

Mise en place
6 chicken thighs cut into 2cm pieces

1 tbsp finely chopped garlic
1 tbsp finely chopped ginger

3 pears, peeled and cut into 2cm pieces
1/2 cucumber cut into 2cm pieces

250ml chicken stock
2 tbsp light soy
1 tsp crushed black pepper
2 tsp corn starch

Firing
Lightly salt the chicken pieces and sear them off on a hot pan. Set aside.

Create a sauce with the chicken stock, soy, black pepper and corn starch.

Heat about 2 tbsp oil in a wok until hot and add the ginger and garlic. Stir fry for about 30 seconds. Add the pears and cucumbers and stir fry together for another 30 seconds, until the wok heats up again. Add the chicken pieces and stir fry for another 30 seconds. Add the sauce and cook on high heat, stirring constantly until it thickens (it may take less than a minute). Serve.
