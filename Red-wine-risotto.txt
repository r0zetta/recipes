Red wine risotto

Mise en place
1 large finely chopped onion

200g grated parmesan

1 bottle red wine

Risotto rice

1 liter chicken stock

1 tsp dried thyme
1 small handful of dried chanterelles

crushed black pepper

Firing
Prepare a saucepan with about 1 liter of chicken stock and keep it on low simmer. Add to this a pinch of thyme, about a tablespoon of crushed dried forest mushrooms and some freshly cracked black pepper.

Heat about 4 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan on moderate heat and add 1 large very finely chopped onion. Fry the onion gently for about 5 minutes until it has sweated off but not turned brown. Pour in risotto rice, covering the bottom of the pan to about a half a centimeter and heat, while stirring constantly for several minutes, toasting the rice until it gets translucent and slightly toasted looking.

Slowly pour in about half a bottle of red wine and mix well. Allow the wine to reduce, while stirring for a few minutes.

Keeping the heat low on the frying pan, ladle the stock into the rice mixture until it just covers the surface of the rice. Stir the mixture gently all the time and continue to top up the liqud level as it gets absorbed by the rice.  Check a grain of rice every now and then and continue with this process (which should take about 20 minutes) until the rice is no longer hard in the middle. The mixture should be creamy if you have stirred and massaged the rice correctly while cooking. Make sure there is still an excess of liquid in the pan at this point (do not let it get thick). Mix in 2 handfuls of finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. The mixture should still be quite liquidy, such that if you pull rice from the side of the pan, the liquid and rice slowly seep back into the space created. the liquid should thick, but the grains of rice should move freely and not be lumped together.

Drizzle a few tablespoons of olive oil onto the risotto and serve immediately.
