Lentejas a la Riojana

Mise en place

1 medium sized onion, finely diced
3 cloves garlic, finely diced
1 packet of bacon, cut into 1/2cm strips
1 chorizo, cut into 1/2cm slices on the diagonal
3 tbsp canned crushed tomato
1 tbsp smoked paprika
1 tbsp black pepper
250g green lentils
200ml wine

Firing
Saute the bacon and chorizo slices in a saucepan on medium heat until crispy.
Remove the meat from the pan and discard oil, leaving about 2 tbsp in the pan.
Reheat oil and add the onions and garlic. Cook for about 4 minutes. Return the
bacon and chorizo to the pan and mix. Add the wine and allow it to reduce most
of the way down. Add the crushed tomato, smoked paprika, black pepper and green
lentils, followed by about 1 liter of water. Allow to simmer gently for about 90
minutes, stirring occasionally until the lentils are cooked.
