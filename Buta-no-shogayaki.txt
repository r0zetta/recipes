Buta-no-shogayaki

Mise en place
400g thinly sliced pork

3 green onions, green parts only cut to 4cm lengths

1/4 cabbage thinly shredded

Sauce
1 tsp sugar
2 tsp finely grated ginger
2 tbsp light soy sauce
2 tbsp sake
2 tbsp mirin

Lay out the pork slices on a board and add some salt and pepper. Very lightly dust with flour. Heat a frying pan with about 2 tsp sesame oil. Fry the porke slices seasoned side down in batches ensuring the pork slices are in full contact with the pan and not overlapping. When the seasoned side is slightly crispy, turn over and fry the other side. Set aside the cooked pieces as you fry the remainder of the pork.

Return all of the cooked pork to the frying pan and warm up. Pour the sauce directly onto the bottom of the pan and once it starts to boil, mix it with the pork slices. Cook for about 1 minute, until the sauce has slightly reduced and thickened.

Serve on a plate next to the shredded cabbage and green onion slices.
