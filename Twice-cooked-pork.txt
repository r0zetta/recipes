Twice Cooked Pork

Mise en place
800g pork belly or similar, braised and cut into thin slices

5 cloves garlic chopped
An equal quantity of finely chopped ginger

4 green onions cut into 4cm pieces

2 tbsp chili bean paste

Sauce:
1 tbsp light soy sauce
1 tbsp sherry
1 tsp sugar
1 tbsp tianmianjiang (substitute with a 1:1 mixture of miso and plum sauce)

Pork preparation
Put the pork into a saucepan and just cover with boiling water. Add one star
anise and 5 szechuan pepper corns. Cover and simmer the pork on low heat for 20
minutes. Remove the pork from the water, wrap in foil and allow to cool. Slice
the pork into thin slices about 3cm squared in size.

Firing
Heat a wok to high heat and add about 2 tbsp oil. Add the pork pieces to the oil
and allow them to fry until a little crispy, moving them around occasionally.
Once ready, move the pork to one side of the wok and tip out all but about 1
tbsp of the oil. With the pork slices still to one side, add the ginger and
garlic to the oil and fry until fragrant. Add the chili bean paste to the
garlic, ginger and oil and allow to fry until fragrant. Mix everything with the
pork. Add the sauce, mix and allow to boil a little until reduced slightly. Add
the green onions. Serve.
