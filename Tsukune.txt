Add 1 tsp salt to the ground chicken and knead the meat until it is smooth. Add
the chopped onion, beaten egg, grated ginger and potato starch. Mix into a
paste. Heat a frying pan and add some oil to coat the bottom. Make small balls
of the chicken mixture by squeezing the mixture out of one hand into a spoon and
then placing onto the pan. Cook on each side. Mix the sauce and add it to the
pan. Cook the sauce for about 1 minute, until thickened and then mix to coat the
balls in the sauce. Serve with raw egg yolk as a dipping sauce.
