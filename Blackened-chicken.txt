Mexican Blackened Chicken

Mise en place
6 deboned, skinless chicken thighs

100g mature cheddar, grated

1/4 iceberg lettuce shredded

Large Flour Tortillas

Mexican sauces (red, green)

1 small onion, finely diced
1 bunch coriander, chopped

Spice rub:
1 tsp smoked paprika
1 tsp cumin powder
1 tsp onion powder
1 tsp garlic powder
2 tsp hot chili powder
1 tsp dried oregano
2 tsp salt

Firing:
Place the chicken thighs in a large bowl and add 2-3 tbsp olive oil. Coat the chicken pieces thoroughly. sprinkle the spice rub over the chicken pieces and mix well.

Place the chicken pieces on the barbeque and allow to cook for about 5 minutes each side, until the chicken is cooked through and the spice rub has blackened in places. Remove from the grill, place in a bowl and cover with foil for about 3 minutes. After the chicken is rested, cut each thigh piece into 1cm strips.

Place a tortilla onto the grill and allow to heat for about 1 minute, rotating occasionally, until there are slight char marks on the bottom and the edges have become a little crispy. Flip the tortilla and allow to heat on the other side.  It should start to puff up in places. Rotate occasionally and remove after about 1 more minute. Repeat for all tortillas.

Place some chicken pieces on a tortilla. Pour some sauce onto the chicken.  Sprinkle some onions, coriander, grated cheese and lettuce on top and fold the tortilla into a burrito or wrap.
