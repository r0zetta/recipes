Mise en place
400g chicken thigh meat cut into 2cm cubes

1 large onion cut into 1cm thick strips

3 eggs lightly beaten

1 sheet of toasted nori cut or ripped into small pieces

1 tsp dashi stock powder

1 tbsp light soy
1 tbsp sake
1 tbsp mirin
1 tsp white sugar

Firing
Fill a frying pan to about 3cm with water and heat the pan. Add the dashi stock,
soy sauce, sake and sugar and wait for the broth to boil. Add the onion slices
to the stock and place a lid on the pan, allowing the broth to simmer for 2
minutes on low/medium heat. Add the chicken pieces to the broth and place a lid
on the pan. Allow the mixture to simmer until the chicken is cooked through (a
few minutes). Take the lid off and pour half of the egg mixture into the broth.
Switch off the heat completely. After about 2 minutes, add the remaining egg.

Pour the mixture over a bowl of rice and top with nori pieces.
