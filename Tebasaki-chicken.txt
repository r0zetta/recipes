Firing
Mix the sauce ingredients in a pan and bring to a boil. Simmer the sauce for a few minutes on low heat to reduce slightly. Remove to a bowl and add the vinegar.

Dry the chicken wings with paper towels. Lightly salt each side of the chicken.  Place chicken into a bowl and add 1 tbsp sake and 1 tbsp ginger root juice and allow to sit for at least 10 minutes.

Remove the chicken wings and pat dry. Place the wings into a plastic bag with the potato stach and shake to coat evenly. Pat off excess flour.

Place the wings into a pan with enough oil to almost cover the wings. Starting from cold, heat the pan until the chicken is deep frying. Turn the chicken once golden brown on one side and cook the other side. Remove the drain the wings slightly and place them into a bowl with the tebasaki sauce. Remove the wings from the sauce and place on a plate. Spoon more sauce onto the wings. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds, black pepper, sansho pepper and ichimi red chili powder.
