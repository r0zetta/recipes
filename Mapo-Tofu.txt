Mapo Tofu

Mise en place

3 packets firm tofu cut into 1.5cm cubes
400g pork mince
3 cloves garlic, finely minced
2 tsp finely chopped ginger
3 green onion stalks cut into 1/2cm slices on the diagonal
1/2 tsp freshly crushed szechuan peppercorns
slurry of 3 tsp cornstarch in about 4 tbsp water
2 tbsp hot bean sauce
1 tbsp fermented black beans
1 tbsp sugar
2 tbsp light soy
300ml chicken stock

Firing
Place the tofu cubes carefully into a colander and immerse it in boiling water for about 2 minutes to cook the tofu. Remove the colander from the water, leaving the tofu untouched.

Heat 2 tbsp oil in a wok and add the ginger and garlic, frying for about 30 seconds, until fragrant. Add the pork mince and stir fry until fully cooked.  Move the pork to one side and add the hot bean sauce and fermented black beans to the wok, frying for about 30 seconds to activate. Add the chicken stock, sugar and soy sauce, mix everything and allow the liquid to come to a boil. Once at a boil, add the corn stach slurry one teaspoon worth at a time, stirring between each addition until the sauce thickens. Carefully add the tofu cubes and stir them into the sauce. Serve sprinkled with szechuan peppercorn powder and green onions.
