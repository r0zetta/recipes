Fish fragrant pork

Mise en place
500g pork cut into 7cm matchstick pieces, marinated

1 small can bamboo shoots cut into matchstick thickness
An equal quantity of dried chinese mushrooms (e.g. black fungus) rehydrated in hot water for 30 minutes and then cut into thin strips

2 green onions, thinly sliced

5 garlic cloves, finely chopped
An equal quantity of finely chopped ginger

3 tbsp chili paste

Marinade:
1 tbsp light soy sauce
1 tbsp corn starch
1 tbsp sherry
1 tbsp water

Sauce:
1 tbsp sugar
1 tbsp Chiankiang vinegar
1 tbsp light soy sauce
1 tsp corn starch
3 tbsp water

Heat about 1 inch of oil in the wok. Add the shredded pork and fry for 2-3
minutes. Remove the pork pieces and discard all but about 2 tbsp of oil. Heat
the remaining oil and add the ginger and garlic. Fry until fragrant. Add the
pork back into the wok and fry briefly. Move the pork aside in the wok and add
the chili paste to the oil in the bottom of the wok. Allow it to fry until
fragrant and then mix with the pork. Add the mushrooms and bamboo shoots and
mix. Add the sauce to the wok and mix, stirring until it thickens. Add the green
onions and mix. Serve.
