Mise en place
15 dried red chilis
1 tsp szechuan pepper corns

4 cloves garlic chopped finely
An equal amount of finely chopped ginger

600-800g boneless skinless chicken

5 spring onions, cut into 3cm lengths

3 tbsp roasted peanuts

For the marinade:
1 tbsp light soy sauce
1 tbsp sherry/sake
1½ tbsp potato flour
3 tbsp water

For the sauce:
1 tbsp sugar
1 tsp corn starch
1 tbsp dark soy sauce
1 tbsp light soy sauce
2 tbsp Chiankiang vinegar
1 tsp sesame oil
1 tbsp water

Chicken preparation
Cut the chicken into 1cm cubes. Place the chicken in a bowl, add the marinade
and mix well. Let it sit for at least half an hour.

Firing
Heat about 3 tbsp oil in a pan. Add the dried chilis and szechuan pepper corns
and allow to cook until the chilis darken. Add the ginger and garlic and allow
to cook until the raw flavor has gone and the garlic is slightly golden. Add the
chicken pieces in 3 batches, moving the cooked ones aside as you add more until
all the chicken is cooked through. Add the spring onions and mix. Make an
opening in the center of the wok and pour in the sauce. Once the sauce starts to
boil, mix everything well and allow to cook until the sauce slightly thickens
and coats the ingredients. Add the peanuts. Serve.
