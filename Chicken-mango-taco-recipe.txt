Chicken and Mango Tacos

This is a simple recipe that I found on a leaflet from Sainsbury's in London in
the early 90s. I've been making it ever since.

Mise en place
2 medium onions, sliced into 1/2cm strips
1 green and 1 red pepper cut into 1/2cm strips

1 mango peeled and cut into 1cm cubes

400g chicken breat cut into 2cm cubes

1 packet taco seasoning mix

1 packet crispy taco shells

1 liter fresh orange juice

Firing
Lightly salt the chicken pieces and brown them off in a frying pan in some oil.
Set aside.

In the same pan, add a little more oil and add the onions and peppers. Fry for a
good few minutes on high heat to get the onions soft and the peppers slightly
scorched.

Stir in 1 packet of taco seasoning mix. Add fresh orange juice to the pan, just
enough to cover the vegetables and allow it to come to the boil. Simmer and
start to reduce the sauce. Add the chicken pieces back to the pan along with
their juices and continue to reduce. When the sauce has thickened, turn off the
heat stir in the mango pieces.

Serve in soft corn tortillas or crispy corn taco shells.
