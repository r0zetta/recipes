Game Stew

This stew is something I normally prepare with secondary cuts of meat that I
have had access to (mostly reindeer). It can be substituted with secondary cuts
of beef or other red meat or even something like osso bucco pieces.

Make sure your meat is in chunks no more than about 4-5cm cubed (or manageable
pieces). Lightly salt the pieces of meat and sear them off in small batches on all sides in a large saucepan in olive oil. Place the seared meat directly into the casserole dish.

While the pan used to sear the meat is still hot, put one chopped medium size
onion in and fry it for a few minutes. Add the onion to the casserole and mix
with the pieces of meat.

Empty at least a bottle of red wine into the same pan and allow it to heat. Add the following to the wine:
- a few teaspoons worth of freshly cracked black pepper
- about 5 allspice peppercorns
- a large bay leaf
- 2 teaspoons of dried thyme
- optionally, a small piece of cinnamon and about 4 cloves

Allow the wine to reduce to about one third of original volume and then pour the contents into the casserole.

Add boiling water from a kettle to the casserole in order to just cover the meat
pieces and then drop 2 beef stock concentrates in and give it a good stir. Add
about 4cl of Whiskey. Put the lid on the casserole.

Place the casserole in the oven for at least 3 hours, or until the meat has
become as tender as you'd like. If the sauce is still thin, stir in some
crumbled dried pieces of bread a little at a time until it gets a little
thicker (it will thicken a lot as it cools). Once the stew has cooled slightly, mix in a few handfuls of chopped fresh herbs such as parsley. Eat with fresh homemade bread and a portion of spelt cooked in chicken stock.
