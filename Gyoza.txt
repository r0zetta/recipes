Gyoza

Mise en place
About 50 gyoza wrappers

400g mince pork

1 tbsp finely grated ginger

1 very finely chopped onion

1 tbsp sake
1 tbsp soy sauce
1 tsp sugar
1 tsp sesame oil
1 tsp crushed black pepper
1 tbsp oyster sauce

Firing
Place the ground pork in a bowl and add a little salt. Knead the pork mixture
until it is soft a gooey. Add the ginger, sake, soy sauce, sugar, sesame oil,
pepper and oyster sauce to the pork and mix well. Add the onions to the pork and
mix well.

Fill each gyoza wrapper and place onto a try that has been dusted with flour.

Heat a non-stick pan and coat the bottom with a little sesame oil. Place the
gyoza onto the pan and add boiling water up to about 1.5 cm. Place the lid on
the pan and cook for about 5 minutes, until most of the water has boiled off.
Sprinkle a little more sesame oil around the gyoza and replace the lid for
another 2 minutes, until the bottoms of the gyoza are crispy. Serve with a
dipping sauce made from a  mixture of blask vinegar and chili oil.
