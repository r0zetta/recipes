Sour Cream and fennel chicken wings

Mise en place
1kg chicken wings

Marinade
1 small pot of sour cream
2 tbsp fennel seeds
2 tbsp crushed black pepper
1 tsp salt
1 tsp sugar
hot sauce

Firing
Lightly salt the chicken wings and place them on a baking rack over a baking
tray. Cook in the oven at 200C for about 45 minutes. Remove from the oven and
allow to cool slightly.

Mix the sauce ingredients. Place the cooked chicken wings in a bowl and add the
sauce. Stir well to mix. Cover and leave overnight to marinate.

Crisp the wings up either on the barbeque or in the oven at 225C. If the oven
method is used, sprinkle some finely chopped onion on top of the wings before
placing in the oven. The onion pieces will burn and add a nice fragrance.
