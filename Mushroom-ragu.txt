Mise en place

1 medium onion, finely diced
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
700g mushrooms (any kind, an assortment is better), finely chopped
approx 200ml wine (red or white)
1 tsp oregano
Salt and Pepper
Olive oil
Butter

Firing
Heat about 2 tbsp olive oil on a saute pan. When the oil is hot, add about 1 tbsp butter. Add the onions and garlic and a pinch of salt and saute for 4-5 minutes, until slightly golden. Add about 1/4 of the chopped mushrooms and cook until softened. Add another 1/4 of the mushrooms and repeat until all the mushrooms have softened.  Continue to cook the mushrooms and onions, allowing the moisture to leave the mushrooms and evapourate until no more liquid can be seen in the pan. Add oregano and the wine to deglaze and allow the wine to reduce substantially while stirring. Add about 300ml water to the pan and allow the mushrooms to continue to cook while the water is reducing until the sauce is at the desired consistency. Season with salt and pepper.

Add freshly cooked pasta (for instance spinach ravioli) to the sauce and mix well. Serve topped with finely grated fresh parmagiano reggiano.
